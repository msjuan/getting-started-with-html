  <h1>Important concepts</h1>
  
  <b>How the Web Works</b>
  
  <p>Browser makes request via the internet to servers.  The servers host
  files that make up the web.</p>
  
  <b>HTML</b>
  
  <p>Web pages are made up of Hyper Text Markup Language, or HTML. </p>
  
  <p>We learned about tags.  With tags you can make text <b>bold</b> <em>italicized</em></p>
  
  <p>We also learned about anchor tags.  Anchor tags are for making links like this one <a href="www.reddit.com"> derp </a></p>

<img src="url" alt= "test"><br>The pictures I used were way too big for this example.

  I'm sure there were many other things that we learned in this first section That I missed.
  I look forward to learning new thinks in this coruse.
